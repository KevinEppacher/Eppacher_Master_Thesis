I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Simon Schwaiger, MSc, for his continuous guidance, expertise, and the time he dedicated to supervising this thesis. His constructive feedback, clear perspective, and support throughout the research and writing process were invaluable and greatly contributed to the quality of this work.

I am also thankful to UAS Technikum Vienna for the opportunity to pursue this topic and for providing the necessary resources and infrastructure to carry out the project. In particular, I appreciate the access to the mobile robot platform and supporting equipment that enabled the real-world experiments and made a practical validation of the proposed approach possible.

Thanks go to my fellow students and colleagues for the many discussions, critical questions, and helpful suggestions along the way. Their advice and encouragement, as well as the shared problem-solving during challenging phases, provided both technical insight and much-needed motivation.

I am deeply grateful to my girlfriend, friends, and family for their unwavering moral support, patience, and understanding throughout this demanding period. Their encouragement helped me stay focused and confident, especially during stressful milestones.

Finally, I would like to thank everyone who believed in me and supported me in ways both big and small. This thesis would not have been possible without that trust and encouragement.
