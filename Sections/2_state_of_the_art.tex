\chapter{State of the Art}
\label{ch:sota}

In this chapter, the current state of research in semantic multi-object search, map reconstruction, and object detection is reviewed. The goal is to identify strengths and limitations of existing methods and establish the technological context for the proposed hybrid approach. The chapter is divided into three key areas: approaches for searching multiple objects semantically, techniques for building and maintaining persistent semantic maps, and recent advances in object detection and promptable models for open-vocabulary tasks.

\section{Geometric Exploration}

A \textit{frontier} is defined as the boundary between known free space and unknown regions of the environment~\cite{lluviaActiveMappingRobot2021}. Frontier-based exploration relies on the principle that unexplored areas adjacent to known free regions provide the highest potential information gain. To identify such frontiers, the robot must maintain a global representation of the environment, typically an occupancy grid or voxel map, where each cell is classified as \textit{free}, \textit{occupied}, or \textit{unknown}, based on sensor observations from \ac{LiDAR} or RGB-D cameras. The robot then iteratively selects and navigates to frontiers to expand its knowledge of the environment.

\citeauthor{quinApproachesEfficientlyDetecting2021}~\cite{quinApproachesEfficientlyDetecting2021} evaluated three commonly used frontier extraction methods that differ primarily in computational efficiency and scalability.  
The first approach, known as the \textit{Naïve Active Area (NaïveAA)} method, evaluates every cell in the occupancy grid to determine whether it is free and has at least one unknown neighbor. Although this approach is conceptually simple and accurate for small-scale maps, it becomes computationally expensive for larger environments and often produces small, fragmented frontier clusters.

The second approach, the \textit{Wavefront Frontier Detector (WFD)}~\cite{quinApproachesEfficientlyDetecting2021,topiwalaFrontierBasedExploration2018}, improves efficiency by using a breadth-first search (BFS) to identify connected frontier regions without exhaustively scanning the entire map. Unlike the NaïveAA method, WFD directly extracts continuous frontier clusters rather than treating each frontier cell individually, significantly reducing redundant computations.

The third method, the \textit{Frontier-Tracing Frontier Detection (FTFD)}~\cite{quinApproachesEfficientlyDetecting2021}, further enhances performance by incrementally updating frontier information using only the most recent sensor observations. Instead of re-evaluating the full map, FTFD initiates a BFS from previously known frontier cells that remain within the active area and from the endpoints of the latest sensor rays. Newly visible free-space cells along the scan boundary are evaluated as potential frontiers, while outdated frontier cells that are now occupied or re-observed are removed. By restricting computation to the local scan perimeter, FTFD achieves significantly faster update rates than NaïveAA and WFD, supporting real-time frontier detection even in large-scale environments.

After frontiers have been extracted, a selection strategy determines which frontier the robot should explore next. Simple heuristics such as \textit{nearest-frontier selection} minimize travel distance but can lead to oscillatory behavior between nearby frontiers. Alternatively, selecting the \textit{largest frontier} favors unexplored regions of higher spatial extent, reducing dead-end visits but increasing traversal cost.  
To address these trade-offs, \citeauthor{bourgaultInformationBasedAdaptive2002}~\cite{bourgaultInformationBasedAdaptive2002} introduced a \textit{utility-based frontier selection} framework that combines multiple criteria, such as distance, frontier size, and expected information gain, into a unified objective function. This approach enables more balanced decision-making, improving overall exploration efficiency and map completeness. Many subsequent works have built upon this foundation, incorporating additional factors such as energy consumption, obstacle density, and dynamic environment considerations into the utility function~\cite{lluviaActiveMappingRobot2021}.

However, all these methods are primarily designed for geometric exploration without incorporating semantic understanding. As a result, they are optimized for complete map coverage rather than goal-directed exploration tasks. In scenarios where a robot must locate specific objects or regions based on semantic cues, purely geometric frontier selection often leads to inefficient search behavior and unnecessary traversal. This motivates the integration of semantic reasoning into the frontier-based exploration process, where frontiers can be prioritized not only by geometric utility but also by their semantic relevance to the task objective.
