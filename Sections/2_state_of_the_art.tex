\chapter{State of the Art}
\label{ch:sota}

In this chapter, the current state of research in semantic multi-object search, map reconstruction, and object detection is reviewed. The goal is to identify strengths and limitations of existing methods and establish the technological context for the proposed hybrid approach. The chapter is divided into three key areas: approaches for searching multiple objects semantically, techniques for building and maintaining persistent semantic maps, and recent advances in object detection and promptable models for open-vocabulary tasks.
\section{Geometric Exploration}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Geometric exploration aims to explore unknown environments by navigating toward frontiers — the boundaries between known and unknown space — typically within a SLAM-based mapping framework.
    
    \item Selecting the frontier closest to the robot minimizes path cost (\textit{greedy strategy})~\cite{topiwala2018frontierbasedexplorationautonomous}.  
    \textit{Advantage:} simple and efficient.  
    \textit{Limitation:} ignores potential information gain.
    
    \item Prioritizing frontiers based on maximum expected information gain (e.g., entropy, mutual information) enables more informative exploration~\cite{bourgault2002informationbasedadaptiveexploration, Suresh_2024}.
    
    \item Selecting the largest frontier clusters improves stability and continuity in exploration~\cite{stachniss2009efficientexploration}.
    
    \item These approaches are purely geometric and lack semantic awareness. They are not suitable for open-vocabulary object queries or multi-object search tasks requiring semantic reasoning.
\end{itemize}

\section{Vision-Language-Guided Exploration}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Review of methods targeting simultaneous or sequential search for multiple objects in unknown environments.

        \item SemUtil~\cite{chen2023semutil}
        \item ESC~\cite{liu2023esc}
        \item LGX~\cite{shah2024lgx}
        \item CoW~\cite{qi2023cow}
        \item ZSON~\cite{shah2023zson}

        \item Real-Time Capability
        \item VRAM Requirements

        \item Semantic reasoning (BLIP2, CLIP, GPT-4V, etc.)
        \item Persistent Memory (None, 2D Map, 3D Map, Scene Graph)

    \item Evaluation of performance metrics used in multi-object search:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Success Rate (SR) 
        \item Success weighted by Path Length (SPL)
        \item MSR (Multi-object Success Rate)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Discussion of semantic exploration frameworks combining language models with spatial reasoning.
    \item Challenges of maintaining semantic context across multiple targets.
\end{itemize}

\section{Map Reconstruction and Persistent Semantic Mapping}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Overview of approaches to build and update semantic maps during exploration:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item 2D grid maps
        \item Pointclouds
        \item Voxel grids
        \item Octomaps
        \item Scene graphs
        \item Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs)
        \item Feature Fields
    \end{itemize}
    \item Techniques for fusing sensor data into persistent 2D/3D representations:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Storing Visual Embeddings (e.g., CLIP features) in 3D maps for semantic querying.
        \item Incremental updating of semantic labels based on new observations.
        \item Handling uncertainty and conflicting detections over time.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Comparison of representations (Octomaps, point clouds, voxel grids) in terms of:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Memory efficiency.
        \item Ability to store semantic labels persistently.
    \end{itemize}
