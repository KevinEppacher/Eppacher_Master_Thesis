\chapter{Implementation}
This section details the practical implementation of the proposed approach, covering the simulation and real-world setup, datasets, software stack, and hardware configuration.

\section{Simulation Environment}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Evaluation of simulation frameworks for indoor semantic navigation:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item HabitatSim: Realistic Matterport3D-based environments with semantic annotations.
        \item Isaac Sim / Isaac Lab: GPU-accelerated simulation, advanced physics, support for RTX ray tracing.
        \item MuJoCo: High-speed physics engine, limited support for complex indoor scenes.
        \item Ignition Gazebo: Modular simulator, ROS2 integration, good for real-robot transfer.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \dots
\end{itemize}

\section{Dataset}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use of \textbf{Matterport3D} scenes for realistic indoor environments with ground truth 3D reconstruction and semantic annotations.
    \item Incorporation of the \textbf{Habitat Navigation Challenge 2023} tasks to benchmark exploration and navigation performance (SR, SPL).
\end{itemize}

\section{Software Setup}
\begin{itemize}
    \item ROS2-based implementation (Humble Hawksbill) as middleware.
    \item Navigation stack: Navigation2 (Nav2) for frontier-based exploration and path planning.
    \item DDS communication layer for distributed communication between detection, mapping, and control nodes.
    \item Custom RobotDriver for interfacing with real robot hardware.
    \item Integration of promptable models (SEEM, GroundingDINO, etc.) for real-time zero-shot detection during exploration and exploitation.
    \item \dots
\end{itemize}

\section{Hardware Setup}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{PC:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 5950X 16-Core Processor
        \item Motherboard: B550 Gaming X V2
        \item GPU: ASUS TUF Gaming RTX 4090 24GB OC Edition
        \item RAM: 64GB Corsair Vengeance LPX DDR4
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Real Robot:} Configuration and components to be determined (tbd).
\end{itemize}
