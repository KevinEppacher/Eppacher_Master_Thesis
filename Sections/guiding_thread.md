# Introduction
## Problem Statement
- Domain and relevance:
    - Service Robotics --> Vaucuum Robot searching for fridge in the Kitchen with semantic Input Prompt
    - Search and Rescue (SAR)--> using one or mutliple robots to search persons, with the hint, that they may be in the bathroom
    - Inspection --> Robot needs to autonomously explore unteleoperational areas with semantic input
