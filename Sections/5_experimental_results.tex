\chapter{Discussion and Results}
\label{ch:results}
This chapter presents the experimental evaluation of the proposed hybrid semantic exploration system. Each experiment targets a specific research question and is evaluated using quantitative performance metrics.

\section{Experiment 1: Benchmarking on Matterport Scenes}
Evaluates baseline performance in multi-object search compared to state-of-the-art frameworks (OneMap, VLFM, Pigeon) using SR, SPL, and MSR.

\section{Experiment 2: Impact of Exploration–Memory Weighting}
Analyzes how varying the balance between live exploration and persistent memory influences navigation efficiency and task success.

\section{Experiment 3: Sensitivity to Semantic Map Granularity}
Investigates how varying the semantic retrieval depth affects mapping robustness and overall navigation stability.

\section{Experiment 4: Effect of Multi-Source Semantic Fusion}
Examines how combining detection confidence, semantic similarity, and memory reliability improves detection robustness and reduces false positives.

\section{Experiment 5: System Efficiency and Real-World Validation}
Assesses runtime performance, resource utilization, and stability under real-world sensor noise during physical deployment.
